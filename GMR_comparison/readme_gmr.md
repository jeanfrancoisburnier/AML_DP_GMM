** GMM_reg ** : A machine learning algorithm that use the Gaussian Mixture Model to do regression. The GMM-reg uses files of the machine learning toolbox ML_toolbox that you can find here : https://github.com/epfl-lasa/ML_toolbox/

To see how the algorithm is working, chose a dataset that needs to be in the path. Then you can use the training ratio and the hyperparameters are determined using the EM-step. From the graph you can select the number of cluster before running the regression.
